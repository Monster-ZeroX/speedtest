# SpeedTest
Just enter the URL of the page you'd like to test in the input field and select 'Go' or hit the enter key. Then you can manually resize the preview below by clicking and dragging the bottom right corner to any size you wish, or by jumping to predefined widths by pressing the 1–9 and ∞ buttons at the top of the screen, or pressing number keys 1–0 on the keyboard to jump to the predefined widths. Great for testing pages at specific widths very quickly, and for making it possible to change the width you're viewing a page when using a device with a fixed-width (like a phone or tablet). http://staticresource.com/speedtest.html
